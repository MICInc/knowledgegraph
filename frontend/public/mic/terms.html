If you do not agree to any of these terms, or the Submission Guidelines, please do not use the Service. Although we may attempt to notify you if and when major changes are made to these Terms of Service, you should periodically review the most up-to-date version http://www.parkourtheory.com/path/terms). Parkour Theory may, at its sole discretion, modify or revise these Terms of Service and policies at any time, and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. Nothing in these Terms of Service shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits.

                            <br>These Terms of Service apply to all users of the Service, including but not limited to users who are also contributors of Content on the Service. “Content” includes the text, software, scripts, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, audiovisual combinations, interactive features and other materials you may view on, access through, or contribute to the Service. The Service includes all aspects of Parkour Theory, including but not limited to all products, software and services offered via the Parkour Theory website, such as the Parkour Theory search engine and other applications. The Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by Parkour Theory. Parkour Theory has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition, Parkour Theory will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Service, you expressly relieve Parkour Theory from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website. Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware of when you leave the Service and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each other website that you may visit.

                            <br>Parkour Theory hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that: You agree not to distribute in any medium any part of the Service or the Content without Parkour Theory's prior written authorization, unless Parkour Theory makes available the means for such distribution through functionality offered by the Service. You agree not to alter or modify any part of the Service. You agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the video playback pages of the Service itself, or other explicitly authorized means Parkour Theory may designate. You agree not to use the Service for any of the following commercial uses unless you obtain Parkour Theory's express prior written approval: the sale of access to the Service; the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on or within the Service or Content; or the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing Content delivered via the Service, unless other material not obtained from Parkour Theory appears on the same page and is of sufficient value to be the basis for such sales. You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Parkour Theory servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parkour Theory grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. Parkour Theory reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information from the Service, nor to use the communication systems provided by the Service (e.g., submission forms, bug report forms, email) for any commercial solicitation purposes. In your use of the Service, you will comply with all applicable laws. Parkour Theory reserves the right to discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time prior without notice.

Parkour Theory does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights on the Service, and Parkour Theory will remove any and all Content if properly notified that such Content infringes on another's intellectual property rights.

No waiver of any term of this these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Parkour Theory's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

Your use of the Service following any amendment of these Terms of Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of its revised terms.
